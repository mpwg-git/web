Hi Tanja!\n\nMy name is Zala, I’m 23 years old, originally from Slovenia. In September I’m coming to Vienna to do my studies, more precisely, to work on a project as part of my mobility semester of Cognitive science program.\nI’m looking for a room to rent from sometime in September until the end of February so your room would be perfect for me :) I’ve already lived in a few shared flats in Ljubljana and I never had any problems with my roommates. I am an easy going person, I don’t have any pets (although I love them and I wouldn’t mind if there are pets in an apartment), I like being in a company, go on a party sometimes, have a chat over morning coffee... I like photography, sports (hiking, mtb, handball), travelling...\nIf you have any questions for me, you can contact me via my email - zala.likar@gmail.com or here...\n\nI really hope you think I would be suitable for your apartment and I will be hearing from you soon,\n\nZala
