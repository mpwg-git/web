Hi Camille!\nI have seen your ad on \"whoshowersfirst\" and I may be interested. \nI\'m Marta and I am 23 - almost 24 - years old from Milan (Italy). I am a student and I will be coming to Vienna as a graduate exchange student at WU in the next semester to study International Management, so I\'m looking for a room. \nI am a tidy and responsible person and I had already experiences of living with flatmates in my international exchanges.\nI am quiet, but easygoing, I love sports, movies and travelling.\nI speak Italian (of course!) and English, I also speak German, but it will take me some time to refresh it :)\n\nI would need a room from the 25th of February (although I am flexible on the entry date) to the 25th of May, more or less... Is the room still available? Is it possible to see some pictures?\nThank you very much for your help, hope to hear from you! :)\n\nMarta
