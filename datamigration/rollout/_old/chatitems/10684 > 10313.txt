My name is CÃ©line and I\'m 22 years old. From the end of September on I will be working as a PhD and teacher at the Oriental Institute of the Uni of Vienna. I really love the room you\'re renting. I\'m a quiet person, who loves reading, writing, listening to music, vintage styling, lindy hop dancing and playing the guitar.
